# ps5-esp32
Use a ps5 controller with an ESP32.

This is heavily based on the work of Jeffery Pernis to connect a PS3 controller to an ESP32, and the PS4-esp32 library. 

PS3 controller: https://github.com/jvpernis/esp32-ps3

PS4 controller: https://github.com/aed3/PS4-esp32

[Here's a video](https://youtu.be/BmlKBs27pgE) about how the ps4 library was made.

This repo can be downloaded as a zip file and imported into the Arduino IDE as a library.

## Installation
The instructions on how to do this are base off what can be found [here](https://github.com/jvpernis/esp32-ps3/issues/3#issuecomment-517141523)
1. You can add the ESP32 boards to your Arduino IDE by adding them to the Boards Manager:
    1. Open `File -> Preferences`
    1. Paste the following URL in the `Additional Boards Manager URLs` field:
    `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`
    1. Open the Boards Manager with `Tools -> Board: "xxx" -> Boards Manager`
    1. Look for `esp32` (probably the last one in the list), and click `install`
    1. Select the ESP32 board you have with `Tools -> Board: "xxx"` under the section `ESP32 Arduino`
1. To install this library into your Arduino IDE:
    1. Click on the "Code" button in the top right of this page
    1. Select "Download Zip" (It's always a good idea to look through the code on this page first to make sure you know what you're downloading)
    1. In the Arduino IDE, navigate to `Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library`, then select the file you just downloaded


## Pairing the ps5 Controller:
When a ps5 controller is 'paired' to a ps5 console, it just means that it has stored the console's Bluetooth MAC address, which is the only device the controller will connect to. Usually, this pairing happens when you connect the controller to the ps5 console using a USB cable, and press the PS button. This initiates writing the console's (or in this case an esp32's) MAC address to the controller.

To do this, you'll need to include the controller's ip address in the ```ps5.begin()``` function during within the ```setup()``` Arduino function like below where ```1a:2b:3c:01:01:01``` is the MAC address (**note that MAC address must be unicast**):
```
void setup()
{
    ps5.begin("1a:2b:3c:01:01:01");
    Serial.println("Ready.");
}
```

**TLDR:** Connect ps5 controller with phone through bluetooth. Get the controller's bluetooth MAC address (look in About settings of phone). Replace '1a:2b:3c:01:01:01' with your controller's bluetooh MAC. Same can be done with your ps5 console if more convenient.
##
**Note: This library now supports full PS5 DualSense controller functionality including:**
- ✅ **Buttons and analog inputs** - Fully tested and working
- ✅ **IMU sensors (Accelerometer & Gyroscope)** - Now implemented and working
- ⚠️ **Rumble/haptic feedback and lights** - Implemented but may need testing
- ⚠️ **Touchpad** - Basic structure in place, needs implementation

## Sensor Data Usage

### Accelerometer
The accelerometer measures linear acceleration in 3 axes (X, Y, Z). Values are 16-bit signed integers.
- **Range**: Approximately ±4g (where 1g = 9.81 m/s²)
- **Use cases**: Tilt detection, motion sensing, orientation

```cpp
int16_t accel_x = ps5.data.sensor.accelerometer.x;
int16_t accel_y = ps5.data.sensor.accelerometer.y;
int16_t accel_z = ps5.data.sensor.accelerometer.z;
```

### Gyroscope
The gyroscope measures angular velocity in 3 axes (X, Y, Z). Values are 16-bit signed integers.
- **Range**: Approximately ±2000 degrees per second
- **Use cases**: Rotation detection, gesture recognition, stabilization

```cpp
int16_t gyro_x = ps5.data.sensor.gyroscope.x;
int16_t gyro_y = ps5.data.sensor.gyroscope.y;
int16_t gyro_z = ps5.data.sensor.gyroscope.z;
```

### Example Usage
```cpp
// Check for significant controller movement
if (abs(ps5.data.sensor.accelerometer.x) > 8000) {
    Serial.println("Controller tilted left/right");
}

// Check for rotation
if (abs(ps5.data.sensor.gyroscope.z) > 5000) {
    Serial.println("Controller spinning around Z-axis");
}
```

See `examples/ps5_sensors_example.ino` for a complete working example.
